This is a foosball example app. I is using latest web technology and is kind of a playground to test out new technologies.

To start development, use the npm command `npm start`.
To publish it to github pages use the npm command `npm run publish` wich publishes the app under https://deartacode.github.io/foosball

Have fun :-)
